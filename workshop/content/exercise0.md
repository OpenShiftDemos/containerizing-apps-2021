# Introduction

Welcome to the Containerizing Applications lab! During this 0th lab we make sure
everything is setup correctly.

Expected completion: 10-15 minutes

## Spin up an environment

In an effort to make this lab repeatable, we offer it pre-configured in the [Red
Hat Product Demo system](https://rhpds.redhat.com). For the easiest setup,
please head there and launch the "Containerizing Applications: Existing and New"
item in the "[Catalog](https://rhpds.redhat.com/catalog/explorer)." Proceed to
[Connecting to your environment [RHPDS]](#connecting-to-your-environment-rhpds).

However, if you don't have access to the demo portal, you can also create a new
RHEL8 Virtual Machine and run the [`configure-lab.sh`](./setup/configure-lab.sh)
script in the setup directory in this repo.

```bash
#TODO
$ curl -o configure-lab.sh -L https://gitlab.com/2020-summit-labs/containerizing-applications/-/raw/master/labs/lab0/setup/configure-lab.sh
$ cat configure-lab.sh
$ chmod a+x configure-lab.sh
$ ./configure-lab.sh
```

You will also need an OpenShift instance later in the lab. If you don't have
one, you can use the upstream version by heading to
[OKD.io](https://www.okd.io/). Follow the instructions for whatever way is best
for you. You should find instructions for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

Now proceed to [Getting Set Up](#getting-set-up)

## Connecting to your environment [RHPDS]

Once you launch the demo, you should receive an email with the credentials to
ssh in to the "ClientVM". Do not ssh to the OpenShift Cluster as that isn't used
from the command line in this lab.

## Getting Set Up

Since some of these labs will have long running processes, it is recommended to
use something like `tmux` or `screen` in case you lose your connection at some
point so you can reconnect. If you followed the steps above, you should already
have `tmux`. `screen` is available in EPEL.

In case you get disconnected use `screen -x` or `tmux attach` to reattach once
you reestablish ssh connectivity. If you are unfamiliar with screen, check out
this [quick
tutorial](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/). For tmux
here is a [quick
tutorial](https://fedoramagazine.org/use-tmux-more-powerful-terminal/).

## Lab Materials

Make sure the lab materials are up to date by git pulling the repo:

```bash
$ cd ~/containerizing-applications
$ git pull
```

Now that we have all the content, we need to do a little bit of local
configuration to support the dynamic nature of the lab.

Next, take a look in `~/.bashrc` and make sure you have the following
environment variables, even though they are (likely) not set correctly. You
should have:

 ```bash
$ tail -9 ~/.bashrc
# User specific aliases and functions
# BEGIN ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK
export OS_REGISTRY='OS_REGISTRY_URL'
export OS_API='OS_API_URL'
export OS_ADMIN_USER='opentlc-mgr'
export OS_ADMIN_PASS='r3dh4t1!'
export OS_USER='lab-user'
export OS_PASS='r3dh4t1!'
# END ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK
```

### Environment Variables [RHPDS]
Now please replace `OS_API_URL` in `.bashrc` with the appropriate value. You
should have it in your setup email (and don't forget the ports). The usernames
and passwords should already be set correctly.  We will set `OS_REGISTRY_VALUE`
a little later.

```bash
$ sed -i -e "s|OS_API_URL|<api value you got from the email>|g" ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### Environment Variables [Custom]

Now please replace the values in `.bashrc` with the appropriate values. You
should have them from your OpenShift setup (and don't forget the ports). We will
set `OS_REGISTRY_URL` a little later.

```bash
$ vi ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### Acquire the appropriate version `oc`

In order to interact with OpenShift from the command line we will need a tool
called `oc`. We want to be sure we get the same version as the version of
OpenShift we are using.

```bash
$ curl -L -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.3.1/openshift-client-linux-4.3.1.tar.gz
$ mkdir ~/bin && tar -xf openshift-client-linux-4.3.1.tar.gz -C ~/bin/
```

### Configure lab-user [Custom]

If you are using the RHPDS instance, you can skip the following step as it will
have been done for you. If not, you need to add our `lab-user` to OpenShift
using the `htpasswd` Provider.

We have provided a users.htpasswd file and the custom resource definition for it
in the setup directory.

```bash
$ oc login -u $OS_ADMIN_USER -p $OS_ADMIN_PASS $OS_API
$ oc get secret htpasswd-secret \
    -ojsonpath={.data.htpasswd} -n openshift-config | \
    base64 -d > users.htpasswd
$ htpasswd -bB users.htpasswd $OS_USER $OS_PASS
$ oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret \
    --from-file=htpasswd=users.htpasswd \
    --dry-run -o yaml -n openshift-config | oc replace -f -
```

### OpenShift Registry

Once you have the variables set, you can expose the OpenShift registry and add
it to our variables:

```bash
$ oc login -u $OS_ADMIN_USER -p $OS_ADMIN_PASS $OS_API
$ oc project openshift-image-registry
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster \
    --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
$ sed -i -e "s|OS_REGISTRY_URL|`oc get routes -o jsonpath="{..items[*].spec.host}"`|g" \
    ~/.bashrc #this sets OS_REGISTRY_VALUE
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Now let's make our lab user able to access it:

```bash
$ # user most have logged in at least once
$ oc login -u $OS_USER -p $OS_PASS $OS_API
$ oc login -u $OS_ADMIN_USER -p $OS_ADMIN_PASS $OS_API # go back to admin
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer $OS_USER
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor $OS_USER
```

## OpenShift Container Platform

What is OpenShift? OpenShift, which you may remember as a
"[PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)" to build
applications on, has evolved into a complete container platform based on
Kubernetes. With OpenShift, you can build from a platform, build from scratch,
or anything else you can do in a container, and still get the complete life
cycle automation you loved in the older versions.

You are now ready to move on to the [next lab](../lab1/chapter1.md).
